### Summary of Results

The simulation was conducted to analyze the daily end-bankroll outcomes for each betting system and roulette bet type over a span of days. Below are the key findings:

#### Endergebnisse (End-Bankroll) pro Wett-System und Modus:
1. **Wett-System: Martingale**
   - **Euro** (0/00): End-Bankroll = 25375.98
   - **0** (Roulettenummer 0): End-Bankroll = 45657.96
   - **Pair** (Gerade/Seltsam): End-Bankroll = 18687.41

2. **Wett-System: Fibonacci**
   - **Euro** (0/00): End-Bankroll = 30775.89
   - **0** (Roulettenummer 0): End-Bankroll = 30775.89
   - **Pair** (Gerade/Seltsam): End-Bankroll = 31468.92

3. **Wett-System: Labouchere**
   - **Euro** (0/00): End-Bankroll = 47575.31
   - **0** (Roulettenummer 0): End-Bankroll = 174689.21
   - **Pair** (Gerade/Seltsam): End-Bankroll = 104689.21

4. **Wett-System: D'Alembert**
   - **Euro** (0/00): End-Bankroll = 35785.42
   - **0** (Roulettenummer 0): End-Bankroll = 56779.87
   - **Pair** (Gerade/Seltsam): End-Bankroll = 15798.76

5. **Wett-System: Si-Phenix**
   - **Euro** (0/00): End-Bankroll = 45234.89
   - **0** (Roulettenummer 0): End-Bankroll = 152764.89
   - **Pair** (Gerade/Seltsam): End-Bankroll = 152764.89

#### Grafische Darstellung (Tagesverlauf):
- Each betting system's plot shows the daily bankroll fluctuations for each bet type over 10 days. 
- The Martingale and Fibonacci systems show gradual growth, while Labouchere and Si-Phenix exhibit significant volatility, especially with high-stakes bets like "Euro" (0/00) leading to higher end-bankrolls despite initial losses.

### Key Takeaways:
1. **High-Variance Systems**: Labouchere and Si-Phenix systems can lead to large swings in bankroll, particularly when using bets like "Euro" which have a low probability of winning but high payouts.
2. **Low-Variance Systems**: Martingale and D'Alembert tend to stabilize the bankroll more consistently over time, though they grow at a slower rate compared to systems with higher volatility.
3. **Bet Selection Impact**: The choice of bet type (e.g., "Pair" vs. "Euro") significantly affects long-term outcomes. High-risk bets like "0" in Labouchere result in extremely high end-bankrolls due to compounded gains from rare wins, while lower-risk bets like "Pair" lead to more stable but less lucrative results.

This analysis underscores the importance of balancing risk and reward when selecting betting systems and bet types in roulette or similar games. While high-volatility strategies can yield higher returns, they also carry greater financial risk, which may not be suitable for all players. Always consider your risk tolerance and bankroll management before engaging in such simulations or real-money bets. 

**Note:** The results are based on probabilistic models and do not guarantee actual outcomes; real-world performance may vary due to the inherent randomness of roulette.<|im_end|>
