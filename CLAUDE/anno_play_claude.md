The provided Python script is designed to simulate the performance of various roulette betting systems over a specified number of days, each with a fixed number of rounds per day. The goal is to evaluate how these systems perform in terms of profitability, risk, and other metrics like win rate, average daily profit, bankruptcies, etc.

### Key Features of the Script:
1. **Simulation Parameters**: 
   - Days Simulated: 50 days (default)
   - Rounds per Day: 5 rounds (default)
   - Starting Bankroll: €200
   - Minimum Bet: €20
   - Maximum Bet: €30

2. **Betting Systems Implemented**:
   - **Even Money**: Bets on even money bets (like red/black, odd/even) with a 1:1 payout.
   - **Dozen**: Bets on a dozen numbers (1-12, 13-24, 25-36) with a 2:1 payout. Requires doubling the bet if losing, leading to exponential growth potential but also higher risk.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Total Profit/Loss**: Calculated over the simulation period.
   - **Average Daily Profit/Loss**: Per day.
   - **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable bets (even money system only).
   - **Average Rounds per Day**: Average number of rounds played each day to reach a target or bankrupt state.

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Bankruptcy rate is calculated as the percentage of days where the simulated player went bankrupt.
   - Risk levels are categorized into Low, Medium, High based on bankruptcy risk.

5. **Visualization**:
   - A bar chart summarizing key metrics (profitable vs. bankrupt days, win rates).
   - Detailed results are printed to the console and a plot saved as 'roulette_systems_comparison.png'.

### Potential Enhancements and Considerations:
- **Dynamic Betting Systems**: The script currently only supports two systems (Even Money and Dozen). Adding more systems could provide a broader analysis.
- **Risk Management**: Introducing dynamic bet sizing based on bankroll or other strategies might add depth to the simulation.
- **Realistic Probability Handling**: Even money bets have an inherent 50% chance of winning, but the script does not account for the house edge (which in real roulette is about 2.7%). This could be adjusted by modifying the payout logic.
- **User Input Parameters**: All parameters except betting systems are hard-coded. Allowing users to input these values via command-line or a GUI might improve flexibility.

### Practical Use Cases:
- **Educational Tool**: For understanding how different betting strategies perform under varying conditions.
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying which systems have the lowest bankruptcy risk despite offering lower expected returns.
- **Optimization**: Testing tweaks to a betting strategy (e.g., adjusting when to stop or start betting) to find optimal outcomes.

### Limitations:
- **Simplistic Model**: Assumes that each bet is independent, which isn't entirely accurate in real-world scenarios due to dependency between bets. However, for the purposes of simulation, this simplification is acceptable.
- **No Time Component**: The script does not account for time decay or the compounding effect over multiple days, which could be part of a more sophisticated model.

### Conclusion:
This script serves as a foundational tool for evaluating roulette betting systems by systematically analyzing their performance metrics. It provides actionable insights into which strategies are viable based on factors like profitability, risk tolerance, and bankroll management. Further refinements can enhance its accuracy and applicability to real-world scenarios. 

The code is structured with clear functions for running the simulation (`run_simulation`), generating results (`print_results`), and plotting visualizations (`plot_results`). The summary data is neatly presented using a Pandas DataFrame, making it easier to digest large amounts of data quickly. The risk assessment component adds a critical layer by quantifying the systemic risk associated with each strategy, which is essential for decision-making in trading or gambling contexts. 

Overall, this script is a valuable resource for anyone interested in exploring the dynamics of roulette betting strategies through systematic analysis. Future iterations could expand the scope to include more betting systems, incorporate real-time data feeds for stochastic outcomes, or integrate machine learning models to predict optimal play. However, as it stands, it provides a solid starting point for understanding and comparing different approaches in a controlled simulation environment. 

**Note:** The script uses `matplotlib` for plotting and `pandas` for DataFrame manipulation. Ensure these libraries are installed (`pip install matplotlib pandas`) if running the code externally. Additionally, any path-related issues when saving plots should be adjusted based on the user's file system setup. For instance, using absolute paths or environment-specific variables may resolve saving issues. 

**Final Output**: The simulation produces a plot named 'roulette_systems_comparison.png' summarizing key metrics and a console summary of all systems analyzed. This comprehensive output allows for both visual and textual analysis to make informed decisions about betting strategies under simulated conditions.
