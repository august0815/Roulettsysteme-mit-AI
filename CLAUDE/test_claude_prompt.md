Your code provides a comprehensive simulation of various betting strategies in roulette, each with its own unique approach. Below is a detailed breakdown and assessment of the code structure and functionality.

### Key Components of the Code

1. **System Definition**: Each betting strategy (e.g., Martingale, Reverse Martingale) is encapsulated in a separate function (`martingale_system`, etc.). These functions handle the specific betting logic for their respective strategies.

2. **Simulation Function**: The `simulate_roulette` function models a single run of roulette with the specified strategy. It takes parameters like initial bankroll, maximum rounds, and system-specific details (e.g., bets per round).

3. **Multiple Simulations**: The `compare_systems` function runs multiple simulation runs for each strategy, collecting statistics such as average and median final bankroll, standard deviation, etc.

4. **Plotting Results**: Results are visualized using a bar chart to compare the performance of different strategies.

5. **Statistical Analysis**: Detailed metrics like average ending capital, profit rate, and variance are calculated and printed for each strategy.

### Strengths of the Code

- **Modularity**: Each betting system is its own function, making the code easy to extend or modify.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Includes a variety of strategies from simple (Martingale) to complex (Andrucci, James Bond).
- **Visualization**: The results are plotted using Matplotlib, providing an intuitive comparison of strategy performance.

### Potential Improvements

1. **Handling Ties**: Currently, the simulation assumes that every spin lands on a number that is bet upon. However, some strategies might not cover all numbers (e.g., Martingale only bets on even or odd). Adjustments would be needed if the roulette wheel includes zero and double-zero, as these can sometimes cause issues.

2. **Dynamic Betting Logic**: Some systems (like Labouchere) adjust their betting progression based on previous outcomes. The current setup might not capture this dynamically if implemented using pre-defined bets per round rather than adaptive bets.

3. **Parameter Handling**: The `simulate_roulette` function uses a global dictionary for parameters, which could lead to errors if not managed properly. Encapsulating these into classes or objects might improve clarity.

4. **Efficiency**: For strategies with many possible bets (e.g., Labouchere), generating the bet sequence dynamically during each simulation run could be optimized for efficiency.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's take a closer look at one of the systems, say the Martingale strategy:

```python
def martingale_system(bankroll, outcome):
    bets = []
    if outcome == 0:
        return [0]
    bet_amount = 1
    while True:
        # Place current bet and receive payment
        bet = bet_amount * (2 if is_even(bet) else 1)
        bankroll -= bet_amount
        if outcome in bet:
            bankroll += bet
            bets.append(bet)
            break
        else:
            bet_amount *= 2
    return bets, bankroll
```

This function keeps doubling the bet after each loss until a win occurs. The betting amount is tracked in `bets`, and the final bankroll reflects whether the strategy was successful or not.

### Potential Issues

- **Infinite Loops**: If the simulation runs out of maximum rounds without a win, this could cause infinite loops. The code includes a `max_rounds` parameter to prevent this.
  
- **Outcome Handling**: The function assumes that every spin outcome is either a win (covered by the bet) or a loss (resulting in doubling the next bet). For systems like Martingale, which only cover even money bets, this works. However, if using strategies that don't account for zero (like some outside bets), the code would fail. The current setup assumes all outcomes are covered by at least one bet.

### Conclusion

This code effectively demonstrates how different betting strategies perform under controlled simulations. By comparing their statistical outcomes, users can gain insights into which strategies might be more viable in a simulated environment. However, it's important to note that real-world roulette involves house edges and the presence of zero(s), so these simulations are theoretical and for educational purposes only.

### Final Notes

- **Accuracy**: The code assumes that each bet is independent and that the payout structure (e.g., even money for red/black) is correctly applied. For example, betting on black in European roulette pays 1:1, but the house edge exists because of the zero.
  
- **Visualization**: The bar chart plots ending capital for each strategy over different simulation runs. This can help identify which strategies are more consistent or have higher variance.

Overall, this code is a robust starting point for exploring various betting strategies in roulette and their inherent risks and rewards. Further refinements could make it even more realistic by incorporating the actual house edge and other game mechanics.
