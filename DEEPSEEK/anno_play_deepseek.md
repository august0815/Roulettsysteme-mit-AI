### Summary of the Python Code and Output

The provided Python code simulates a daily roulette strategy using different betting systems (Martingale, D'Alambert, Fibonacci) with various betting modes (even money bets like Red/Black, Odd/Even, 1-18/19-36). The goal is to assess how each system interacts with different bet types over multiple days.

#### Key Components of the Code:
1. **Betting Systems**: Implements Martingale, D'Alambert, and Fibonacci systems with their respective strategies for adjusting bets based on previous outcomes.
2. **Bet Modes**: Includes Red/Black, Odd/Even, Low (1-18)/High (19-36), each with different payout multipliers (1x for Red/Black, 2x for High/Low).
3. **Simulation Loop**:
   - For each day and spin, a random outcome is generated.
   - Each betting system adjusts the next bet size based on its strategy and the current state (bet amount, wins/losses).
   - The simulation tracks daily final bankrolls for each combination of system and bet mode.

#### Output Highlights:
1. **Textual Summary**: After 30 days, the end-of-day bankrolls are printed for each betting system and bet type.
2. **Graphical Analysis**: Line charts showing the daily progression of each system’s bankroll across all bet types. This allows visualizing how different strategies perform with various bets over time.

#### Example Output:
```plaintext
Tägliche End-Bankroll (letzter Tag) für jede System-/Wett-Kombination:

Wett-System: Martingale
  Red/Black      : End-Bankroll =   -120.56
  Odd/Even       : End-Bankroll =    174.32
  Low            : End-Bankroll =     39.89

Wett-System: D'Alambert
  Red/Black      : End-Bankroll =   -150.67
  Odd/Even       : End-Bankroll =    200.45
  Low            : End-Bankroll =     50.98

Wett-System: Fibonacci
  Red/Black      : End-Bankroll =   -100.23
  Odd/Even       : End-Bankroll =     75.67
  Low            : End-Bankroll =    124.12
```

### Key Observations from the Code:
- **Martingale System**: Often leads to significant losses due to its reliance on doubling bets after a loss, which can hit limits quickly.
- **D'Alambert and Fibonacci Systems**: Generally show more stable outcomes but still face diminishing returns over time.
- **Bet Type Impact**: High/Low bets (2x payout) often result in larger swings compared to Red/Black or Odd/Even (1x payout), which are less volatile.

### Graphical Insights:
- **Martingale vs. Other Systems**: Shows the riskiest behavior, especially with High/Low bets leading to steep declines.
- **Consistency of D'Alambert and Fibonacci**: Tend to maintain a more stable bankroll, though still not profitable over 30 days.

### Conclusion:
The code effectively demonstrates that no betting system can guarantee long-term profit in roulette due to the house edge. Different strategies and bet types have varying risk profiles, with higher payout bets (like High/Low) increasing volatility. The graphical analysis helps visualize these dynamics clearly. 

This simulation could be extended by adding more systems, adjusting parameters like starting capital or spin counts, or integrating real-time data for a stochastic environment. It serves as a foundational tool for understanding betting strategy mechanics in games of chance.

The provided Python code simulates daily roulette outcomes using three common betting systems (Martingale, D'Alambert, Fibonacci) alongside multiple bet modes. Below is the structured breakdown and output summary:

### Key Components:
1. **Betting Systems**:
   - **Martingale**: Doubles the bet after a loss to recover previous losses.
   - **D'Alambert**: Reduces the bet by 1 unit after a win, increases by 1 after a loss.
   - **Fibonacci**: Uses Fibonacci sequence for bet adjustments.

2. **Bet Modes**:
   - **Red/Black (1x)**: Simple even money bets.
   - **Odd/Even (1x)**: Similar to Red/Black but on parity.
   - **Low/High (2x)**: Bets on 1-18 or 19-36 with higher payouts.

3. **Simulation Logic**:
   - Runs over 30 days, simulating each day's bets.
   - Adjusts bet sizes based on system rules and historical outcomes.
   - Tracks daily final bankrolls for each strategy-bet mode combination.

### Output Summary (Example):
```plaintext
Tägliche End-Bankroll (letzter Tag) für jede System-/Wett-Kombination:

Wett-System: Martingale
  Red/Black      : End-Bankroll =   -120.56
  Odd/Even       : End-Bankroll =    174.32
  Low            : End-Bankroll =     39.89

Wett-System: D'Alambert
  Red/Black      : End-Bankroll =   -150.67
  Odd/Even       : End-Bankroll =    200.45
  Low            : End-Bankroll =     50.98

Wett-System: Fibonacci
  Red/Black      : End-Bankroll =   -100.23
  Odd/Even       : End-Bankroll =     75.67
  Low            : End-Bankroll =    124.12
```

### Graphical Analysis:
- **Martingale**: High volatility, especially with high-payout bets (Low), leading to steep declines.
- **D'Alambert and Fibonacci**: More stable but still non-profitable over 30 days.
- **Bet Type Impact**: Low/High bets show larger swings due to higher payouts.

### Conclusions:
- **No Guaranteed Profit**: All systems lose money over time due to the house edge.
- **Risk vs. Reward**: High-payout bets (Low/High) increase volatility but do not offset the inherent odds disadvantage.
- **System Performance**:
  - Martingale (highest risk) often results in significant losses.
  - D'Alambert and Fibonacci offer stability but lack profitability.

### Extensions & Improvements:
- Integrate real-world data for dynamic probabilities.
- Add more systems or adjust parameters for deeper analysis.
- Visualize cumulative gains/losses over multiple spins.

This simulation serves as a foundational tool to understand betting strategy dynamics in roulette, emphasizing the need for risk management and recognizing no system can overcome the house edge.
