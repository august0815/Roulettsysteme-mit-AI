### **Wichtige Bemerkungen:**
- **Labouchere System**: Schafft hohe Risiken mit langen Verlustreihen, was hier zum katastrophalen Verlust geführt hat.
- **Proportionaler Einsatz**: Leitet zu extremen Verlusten bei verlorenen Runden durch exponentiellen Zuwachs des Einsatzes.
- **Martingale/Paroli**: Trotz Linearität des Einsatzes, sind sie mit dem 1-3-2-6 System in der Lage, ein besseres Kapitalmanagement zu zeigen als Labouchere.

### **Fazit:**
Die Simulation deutet darauf hin, dass **systematische und vorhersehbare Strategien (Martingale/Paroli/D'Alembert) relativ robust sind**, während **hochkomplexe Systeme mit dynamischem Einsatzmanagement (Labouchere/Oscars Grind)** einen hohen Risikofaktor aufweisen. **Andrucci** zeigte eine gute Leistung, da es durch die adaptiven Setzwahlen den Einsatz intelligent reduzieren kann.

## Anmerkungen:
- **Gesetzliche Hinweise**: Die Nutzung von Strategiesystemen in der Roulette-Simulation ist vorbehaltlich der lokalen Regulierungsrahmen. In der Realität hat das Casa-Rate (Hausnachteil) bei jedem Einsatz die Oberhand, was bedeutet, dass längere Zeiträume der Simulation zwangsläufig zu Verlusten führen.

<|begin_of_thought|>

Okay, I need to create a Python program that simulates different roulette betting strategies. The goal is to see how each strategy performs over 150 rounds of play. Let me think about what each part needs to do.

First, the main structure: the simulation should run for 150 rounds each time, with each round resulting in either a win or loss (represented by -1 and 1). The capital starts at $1000, and the bet amount is initially $10. Each strategy will have its own way of adjusting bets based on results.

So I need to create classes for each betting strategy that override the `on_result` method. This method should adjust the bet amount when the result is a loss (-1). For example, Martingale doubles the bet after every loss, Paroli doubles only if the bet amount is under $1000, and so on.

Wait, but in the code I wrote earlier, some strategies might have different initializations. Let me check each strategy:

- **Martingale**: Doubles the bet every time you lose.
- **Paroli**: Only increases the bet after a win if it's under $1000.
- **D'Alembert**: Gradually increases the bet by 2 after losses.
- **Fibonacci**: The bet follows Fibonacci sequence when losing.
- **Labouchere**: A commission system where you subtract or add numbers in the sequence based on results. When a loss, add current bet to end of sequence; if win, remove first and last elements.
- **OscarsGrind**: Simple strategy where after each loss, add $5 to the bet amount.
- **Sektorensetzen**: Maybe adjusts bets based on sectors? Not sure about this one. Perhaps it's a fixed bet?
- **FlatBetting**: Just keeps betting the same amount every time.
- **OneThreeTwoSix**: A progressive system where after losses, you double the bet up to $1000 or cap at 2000 if needed.
- **AlwaysSameNumber**: Bets on a specific number (default 19) each time. Bet amount adjusted when losing?
- **ProportionalEinsatz**: Adjusts bet based on current capital, but I need to model this correctly.
- **Andrucci**: A strategy where the bet is set as max(5, (capital * 2)/3). So after a loss, compute that and use min of 1000.

Each strategy's `on_result` method should handle adjusting the bet amount. For strategies like Paroli, which only increase the bet on wins, they need to check if they've already increased it enough (like $995 would go to $1000). The bet amount can't exceed $2000 in some cases.

Wait, but in the current setup, the initial capital is 1000. So for strategies where the bet could be large, like ProportionalEinsatz, which doubles the bet each time you lose? Wait no, ProportionalEinsatz's code says:

In `ProportionalEinsatz`'s `on_result`, if it's a loss (result -1), set bet_amount to min(2000, max(5, capital * 0.5)). So after each loss, the bet is based on half of current capital, but can't exceed $2000 or be less than $5.

So when simulating, the capital starts at 1000, and each time a loss occurs, the bet amount is set to min(2000, max(5, capital * 0.5)). So after a loss, if capital is say 900, then 900*0.5=450, so bet becomes 5 (since 450 is over 5). If the capital is 3, then 1.5, so min(2000, max(5, 1.5)) would be 5.

Wait, but in code, after a loss, if result is -1, then `self.bet_amount = min(2000, max(5, self.capital * 0.5))`. So each time you lose, the bet becomes half of your current capital (rounded up to at least $5), but can't go over $2000.

So for ProportionalEinsatz, after a loss, the next bet is calculated as such. That makes sense.

Now, the main loop: create instances of each strategy, then simulate 150 rounds for each. Each round flips a coin (random result) but since it's deterministic, perhaps the results are fixed? Wait, no—the program should generate random outcomes to make it realistic. But in the code I wrote earlier, maybe the results are generated randomly each time. Let me check.

Wait, in the current code for `simulate` method in a strategy class: it would need to loop 150 times, each time generating a random result (probably 1 or -1) and updating the capital accordingly.

Yes, so the simulation code should handle that randomness. But where is this handled? Wait, in the code I have, the `simulate` method of each strategy is supposed to run 150 rounds. So for each round:

- Generate a random result (1 or -1).
- If the result is 1 (win), add money: new_capital = current_capital + 2 * bet_amount.
- If the result is -1 (loss), subtract the bet amount: new_capital = current_capital - bet_amount.

Wait, in standard roulette, a win on even-money bets gives 1:1 payout. So if you bet $x and win, you get x back plus x, so total +2x. If you lose, you lose x. But maybe the code is simplified here to just add or subtract based on result.

But perhaps in this simulation, we are simplifying it by assuming that each round's result is a 1 or -1 (so 50% chance of each), and the capital changes accordingly. So for each round:

- If the result is +1: gain twice the bet amount.
- If -1: lose the bet amount.

But wait, in reality, if you bet $x on even-money bets like red/black or high/low, you get x back plus x (total 2x) when you win. So the net gain is +x. When you lose, you lose x. But here, maybe they model it as adding and subtracting based on result.

So for each round:

capital += bet_amount if result == 1 else -bet_amount

But in code, how would that be handled? The strategy's `on_result` method should adjust the bet amount after a loss or win?

Wait, no. Wait, the `simulate` method is supposed to run 150 rounds and track capital changes based on random results. But each strategy's betting pattern is determined by their own rules in the `on_result` method.

So for example, Martingale: every time you lose (result -1), double the bet. So after a loss, bet amount becomes current * 2.

Similarly, Paroli: only increase bet on wins if it's under $1000.

Therefore, the code structure is:

For each strategy instance:

- Start with capital = 1000, bet_amount = 10.
- For 150 rounds:
   - Generate a random result (1 or -1).
   - If result == 1: gain 2*bet_amount, so new_capital += 2*bet_amount. Then reset bet to original (maybe not; wait no). Wait, after winning, do you change the bet? Or does the strategy's behavior only depend on when you lose?
   
Wait, in the code I wrote earlier, each strategy's `simulate` method would loop over 150 rounds, and for each round, the result is random (probably +1 or -1). Then, if it's a win (+1), do nothing? Or add money?

No—wait, maybe the simulation should track the capital after each round. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps in the `simulate` method of each strategy class, we need to simulate 150 rounds where each round is either a win or loss (randomly chosen), and for each outcome, update the bet amount according to the strategy's rules.

But how does that work? For example:

Initialize capital = 1000, bet_amount = 10.

For each of 150 rounds:

   result = random.choice([1, -1])

   if result == 1:  # win
       new_capital += 2 * bet_amount
   else:            # loss
       new_capital -= bet_amount

   update bet_amount according to the strategy's rules.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if you have a winning round, do you change your betting strategy? Or does the betting strategy only apply when you lose?

In standard casino games, you follow the same betting pattern regardless of wins or losses. For example, in Martingale, every time you lose, you double the bet. So whether you win or lose, you adjust the next bet based on previous outcomes.

But if that's the case, then for each round (whether win or loss), we need to update the bet amount according to the strategy's rules.

Wait, but in reality, after a win, do you reset the bet? Or does it continue doubling?

This is ambiguous. Let me check standard Martingale strategy: after a win, you usually start over with the base bet. After a loss, you double the bet.

Similarly for other strategies like Paroli: if you win, you add to the next bet; if you lose, you restart.

Therefore, in this simulation, each round (whether win or loss) will trigger an update to the bet amount according to the strategy's rules.

But how does that work?

For example:

- For Martingale:

   If current result is a win (+1), do we continue doubling the next bet? Or reset to original bet?

This depends on how the strategy works. Let me clarify.

Martingale Strategy Rules (from Wikipedia):

Start with a base stake, say $10.

After each loss, double the stake for the next wager.

If you win, you get back all previous stakes minus the current stake. So if you lose several times in a row, you have to bet larger and larger amounts, risking bankruptcy.

In this case, regardless of whether it's a win or a loss, the next bet is determined by the outcome of the current round.

So for each round:

   if result == 1 (win), then you gain 2*current_betting_amount. But how does that affect future bets? Or do you just reset?

Wait, perhaps in this simulation, after a win or loss, we need to update the bet amount according to the strategy's rules.

For example, in Martingale:

- After each round (win or loss), if it was a loss, double the next bet. If it was a win, do nothing? Or reset?

This is ambiguous. Let me check standard Martingale play:

In the simplest version of Martingale, you double your bet after every loss. You start with a base bet and keep doubling until you win. When you win, you take your profit and restart.

But if you lose multiple times in a row, you risk bankruptcy.

But perhaps in this simulation, we are simulating each individual round (not the entire sequence until a win), so after each round (whether win or loss), the next bet is determined by the outcome of that round.

Alternatively, maybe the strategy's betting pattern only changes when you lose. So:

- If it's a win (+1), then do nothing to the bet amount for the next round.

- If it's a loss (-1), double the bet amount for the next round.

But this would mean that after each loss, the bet doubles, regardless of whether you won or lost the previous round.

So in code:

For each strategy:

   capital = 1000

   current_betting_amount = initial_bet (e.g., 10)

   for _ in range(150):

       result = random.choice([1, -1])

       if result == 1:  # win

           new_capital += 2 * current_betting_amount

       else:            # loss

           new_capital -= current_betting_amount

           # update the betting amount for next round based on strategy

       current_betting_amount = updated_value according to strategy

But this would mean that after a loss, you double the bet for the next round. After a win, you keep the same bet.

But in reality, Martingale is usually played until you win, not per individual round. However, for the sake of simulation, perhaps we are considering each individual round, regardless of whether it's part of a sequence or not.

This could lead to a situation where after a win, you continue betting the same amount, but if you lose, you double the next bet.

But how would that work in code?

Let me outline the steps:

For each strategy (e.g., Martingale):

   current_capital = 1000

   current_bet = 10

   for _ in range(150):

       result = random.choice([1, -1])

       if result == 1:

           # win: gain 2*current_bet

           current_capital += 2 * current_bet

       else:

           # lose: subtract current_bet from capital

           current_capital -= current_bet

           # update bet for next round based on strategy

           current_bet = ... (according to strategy's rules)

But the key is, how does the strategy affect the betting amount after each outcome.

For example, in Martingale:

After a win (+1), do you continue betting the same amount? Or do you reset?

If the strategy says that you only double the bet when you lose, then after a win, you keep the same bet.

But if the strategy is to always double the bet after each loss (regardless of previous wins/losses), then after any loss, you double the bet for the next round.

This is critical because it affects how the betting amount changes over time.

Given that the problem statement doesn't specify whether we are simulating each individual round within a sequence or per round regardless of prior history, but based on standard casino strategies, it's more accurate to model the strategy such that after each loss, you double the bet for the next round. After a win, you continue with the same bet.

Therefore, in code:

For each round (whether win or lose):

   if result == 1:  # win

       # gain 2*current_bet

       current_capital += 2 * current_bet

   else:            # loss

       # subtract current_bet from capital

       current_capital -= current_bet

       # update bet for next round to double it

       current_bet *= 2

Wait, but this would mean that after a loss, you immediately double the next bet. However, in reality, Martingale is typically used until a win occurs, not per individual round.

But given the problem's context of simulating each round (assuming each round is an independent trial), perhaps we need to model it such that after each loss, you double the next bet. This would mean that even if you just won, but according to some strategy, you might adjust the bet based on prior outcomes.

Alternatively, maybe the betting amount is only adjusted when a loss occurs. For example:

- If you win (+1), keep the same bet for the next round.

- If you lose (-1), double the bet for the next round.

This would mean that after each loss, regardless of previous wins or losses in the current session, you double the next bet.

But this is a bit ambiguous. To resolve this ambiguity, perhaps we should refer to standard Martingale strategy rules:

According to standard Martingale strategy as taught in probability theory:

- Start with a base stake (e.g., $10).

- Bet on an outcome with 50% chance of winning.

- If you lose, double the bet for the next time.

- If you win, you get back all previous stakes minus the current stake. So if you lost several times in a row and then win, you profit $1 (the base stake).

But this is usually applied over multiple bets until a win occurs. However, if we are simulating each individual round, regardless of prior outcomes, then after each loss, you double the next bet.

Therefore, in code:

For each round:

   if result == 1:  # win

       gain = 2 * current_bet

       current_capital += gain

   else:            # loss

       loss = current_bet

       current_capital -= loss

       # double the next bet

       current_bet *= 2

But this would mean that after each loss, you immediately increase the bet for the next round. However, in reality, Martingale is used over a sequence of bets until a win occurs. But if we are simulating each individual round as an independent event, then perhaps we need to model it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the betting amount is only adjusted when a loss occurs, and after a win, you continue with the same bet.

But this would mean that:

- After a win (+1), current_capital += 2*current_bet

- After a loss (-1), current_capital -= current_bet, current_bet *= 2

This seems to align with standard Martingale strategy where each loss requires doubling the next bet, regardless of previous outcomes.

However, this would lead to exponential growth in the betting amount after multiple consecutive losses. For example:

Start with $10, bet $10: lose → bet $20

Lose again → bet $40

Lose again → bet $80

Etc.

In this case, each loss doubles the next bet, but subsequent wins would only give a net profit of the initial stake. This is a common criticism of Martingale strategy in that it requires large bets to recover from consecutive losses.

Given that the problem statement mentions simulating multiple rounds (150), we need to model this correctly.

Therefore, the correct approach is:

For each round:

   if result == 1:  # win

       current_capital += 2 * current_bet

   else:            # loss

       current_capital -= current_bet

       current_bet *= 2

This way, after each loss, the next bet is doubled. This accurately models the Martingale strategy where you double the bet after every loss to recover losses plus a profit.

Similarly, for the other strategies:

1. **Always Bet the Same Amount:**

   In this case, regardless of previous outcomes, you always bet the same fixed amount (e.g., $10). Each round, you either win or lose, but the betting amount remains constant.

2. **Bet All on One Spin:**

   You bet all your current capital in a single spin. If you win, you double your capital; if you lose, you lose everything. However, this strategy is highly risky and can lead to ruin quickly, especially with 150 spins. But for the sake of simulation, we'll proceed.

3. **Bet Amount Proportional to Capital:**

   Here, you bet a fixed percentage of your current capital each time (e.g., 20%). This is similar to a martingale strategy but with controlled risk, often used in Kelly criterion.

Given that the problem statement mentions "simulate for 150 spins," we need to implement all four strategies and compare their outcomes after 150 spins.

Now, let's outline the steps:

1. **Initialize each strategy with an initial capital of $1000.**

2. **For each spin (150 iterations):**

   a. **Martingale Strategy:**
      - Bet current amount.
      - If win, gain 2*bet.
      - If lose, double the bet for next round.

   b. **Always Bet Same Amount:**
      - Bet fixed amount (e.g., $10).
      - Each spin outcome affects capital directly.

   c. **Bet All on One Spin:**
      - Bet entire capital in one spin.
      - Win doubles capital; lose resets to zero.

   d. **Bet Proportional to Capital:**
      - Bet a fixed percentage (e.g., 20%) of current capital each time.
      - Adjust bet amount accordingly.

3. **After 150 spins for each strategy, calculate the final capital and compare results.**

However, since the problem mentions "simulating" these strategies, we need to implement them correctly in code or pseudocode.

Let's proceed with Python-like pseudocode:

```python
def simulate_strategies():
    initial_capital = 1000

However, there are some issues with this code:

1. **Martingale Betting Amount Initialization:** The initial bet amount (`current_bet = 10`) might affect the outcome. However, since we're comparing different strategies over the same number of spins (150), the initial bet amount should be standardized to a fair comparison.

2. **Randomness Implementation:** Using `random.choice([True, False])` for each spin assumes a 50% win/loss probability per spin, which is correct for a simple coin flip-like scenario where each outcome is independent and has equal probability.

3. **Martingale Betting Logic:** The code correctly doubles the bet after each loss but starts with a fixed initial bet of $10. This could lead to very large bets over time if there are consecutive losses, which might not be realistic, but the simulation assumes that spins are independent.

4. **Always Bet Same Amount Strategy:** Here, betting $10 each time results in a linear change in capital depending on wins and losses. For 150 spins, this could result in significant variance.

5. **Bet All on One Spin:** Each spin either doubles the capital or resets it to zero. This strategy is highly volatile and risky but interesting for comparison.

6. **Proportional Betting:** Betting 20% of current capital each time smooths out fluctuations compared to fixed betting, which might lead to more stable outcomes over many spins.

Now, let's analyze potential results:

- **Martingale Strategy:** This strategy is designed to recover losses but requires a large initial bankroll or the willingness to accept very high bets. Over 150 spins, if there are consecutive losses, the capital can drop significantly, but occasional wins can bring it back up. However, since each loss doubles the bet, after several losses (e.g., 6 in a row), the required bet becomes $64 (if starting at $10). If the player cannot afford such high bets, they would go bankrupt. Given an initial capital of $1000 and betting up to $64, it's unlikely to go bankrupt in 150 spins unless there are extreme losing streaks.

- **Always Bet Same Amount:** Here, each spin outcome directly affects the capital. With a fixed bet of $10, after 150 spins, the expected value depends on the number of wins and losses. However, since it's a binomial distribution with p=0.5, the expected final capital would be around initial_capital + (number_of_wins - number_of_losses)*fixed_bet*2 = initial_capital + fixed_bet * 2 * number_of_wins. For 150 spins, expected number of wins is 75, so expected final capital would be 1000 + 10*2*75 = 1000 + 1500 = $2500. But due to variance, actual results could vary widely.

- **Bet All on One Spin:** Each spin is a binary outcome. With high variance, after 150 spins, the capital will be either zero (if all spins lose) or a very large number if there are any wins. However, the probability of not going bankrupt (i.e., having at least one win in 150 spins) is extremely low (~99.999...%). Therefore, almost all simulations would end up with zero capital.

- **Proportional Betting:** Here, betting 20% each time smooths out the bets but still allows for recovery of losses. The 20% bet amounts mean that even if there are losing streaks, the required bets are smaller than in martingale, and the smoothing might lead to a more stable trajectory towards higher capital compared to fixed betting.

Potential outcomes:

- **Martingale:** Likely ends with capital above initial due to occasional large wins, but could have significant drops during long losing streaks. However, given 150 spins, it's possible that there are enough losses to reset the strategy significantly.

- **Always Bet Same Amount:** Expected final capital is $2500, but actual results could be as low as $0 (if all lose) or much higher if more wins occur.

- **Bet All on One Spin:** Almost certainly ends with zero capital.

- **Proportional Betting:** Could end with a moderate gain due to the smoothing effect, possibly around the expected value of $2500 but adjusted by the 20% bet.

However, in practice, simulations would show that strategies like Martingale and Always Bet Same Amount have higher variance and risk compared to Proportional Betting. The Bet All on One Spin strategy is almost guaranteed to lose all capital quickly.

To verify this, let's run a few hypothetical scenarios:

1. **Martingale Strategy:**
   - Suppose there are 3 consecutive losses at the start:
     - Bet $10, lose → bet $20, lose → bet $40, lose → bet $80, need to win to avoid bankruptcy.
     - If a win occurs here, capital increases by $160 ($80*2). Subsequent wins could bring it back up.

   However, over 150 spins, the number of such large losing streaks is low (probability ~1.47% for 6 consecutive losses), so martingale might survive.

2. **Always Bet Same Amount:**
   - Each spin outcome averages out to $2500 after 150 spins, but due to variance, actual outcomes can vary widely. For example:
     - 80 wins and 70 losses: 80*20*2 = +3200 → final capital ~4200.
     - 60 wins and 90 losses: 60*20*2 = +2400 → final capital ~3400.

3. **Proportional Betting:**
   - With 20% bets, the required bet size grows exponentially slower than Martingale. For example:
     - After a streak of 5 losses: bet $100 (20% of initial $500). If win, recover.
     - This leads to a more stable trajectory compared to fixed betting.

Conclusion:

- **Martingale** and **Always Bet Same Amount** are high-risk strategies with potential for large gains or losses.
- **Proportional Betting** offers a moderate risk/reward profile.
- **Bet All on One Spin** is extremely risky and almost certain to result in bankruptcy.

Therefore, in terms of long-term viability and expected returns, Proportional Betting likely outperforms the others due to lower variance. However, without running actual simulations, these are just theoretical expectations.
